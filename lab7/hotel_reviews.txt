I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. I was unsure about the quality given that it is only a 3 star however it was better than the 4 star hotel we stayed in for the remainder of our trip. We booked a room ro basically sleep in for a couple of hours having arrived from Gdansk airport at 2.00am. Reception staff were polite and efficient and checked us in quickly - they spoke English to myself and Polish to my partner. The hotel has been recently refurbished and is beautiful. Massive beds, shower and everything you could need in your room. We used the pool in the morning, which was lovely and clean. The sauna was turned off so we couldn't use it. The gym could be better equipped so we didn't use it. Breakfast was lovely, with lots to choose from. Overall, the only issue we had was with the limited car parking at the hotel. My partner complained and they let us park at the rear of the hotel - it was unclear about parking on the nearby streets and you cannot reserve a space. We will definitely return to this hotel!
As like the title i choose, much below the ibis standards. The only good part was not to have any hygiene issues. Rude front desk staff, especially in kind you would not expect to be working on an international chain. Very poor breakfast, supermarket packed cheese and no eggs. We had to deal with a lot of annoyances. Extremely overvalued for the service offered.
